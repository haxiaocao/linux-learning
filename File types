Definition and information of the file type
How to create particular file type
How to list/see particular file type

Find the desired file types:1) ls -l {path}| grep ^{type}  OR 2) find {path} -type {type}
ls -l {path}| grep ^- 
ls -l {path}| grep ^d
ls -l {path}| grep ^{b,c,p,l,s}
find {path} -type {type}

REGULAR FILES:
1. Readable file or
2. A binary file or
3. Image files or
4. Compressed files etc.

Block file type:
These files are hardware files most of them are present in /dev. 

Character device files:
Provides a serial stream of input or output.Your terminals are classic example for this type of files. 

Pipe files:
The other name of pipe is a “named” pipe, which is sometimes called a FIFO. FIFO stands for “First In, First Out” and refers to the property that the order of bytes going in is the same coming out. The “name” of a named pipe is actually a file name within the file system. 

Symbolic link files:
These are linked files to other files. They are either Directory/Regular File. The inode number for this file and it’s parent files are same. There are two types of link files available in Linux/Unix ie soft and hard link. 

Socket files :
A socket file is used to pass information between applications for communication purpose
